## Linkify

The plan was to build the backend with NestJs in order to explore its features and expand my knowledge in Backend development. But after seeing Supabase I decided to use it as the backend for this project.

It's a backend as a service that provides a Postgres database, authentication, and more.

The frontend is built with NextJS, using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn for layout and styling.
Main features finished:

- User authentication with email and password, future plans to add Google authentication.
- Role based access control and routing protection middleware.

Employer features:

- Add jobs with its details (Title, Description, Salary, Job Type, Level, Salary, ...).

Job Seeker features:

- Manage his profile with personal information.
- Add education and work experience.
- View jobs with search and filter options.
- Apply for jobs using his profile information.
- View applied jobs and their status.

This was a challenge to complete in 24 hours. Although the 24 hours are up, these are the only features I’ve completed so far, and I’ll pause here.
